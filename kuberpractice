ClusterIP:if we wish to access the aap container into the pods or pod within the cluster we can access with the help of
Cluster IP it would be like this : ClusterIP(Service)->Deployment->pods->app container(app container doesn't have an ip)



NodePort:- if we wish to access the app container publically in that case with will use nodeport it will expose one
port number, through that port we will access the app container. it will be like this
NodePort(service)->cluserip(service)->deployment->pod->app container(app container doesn't have an ip)

LoadBalancer:if we wish to access the app container publically but without using any port then we will use loadbalancer.
when we create the load balancer it create Nodeport and cluserip as well.
loadbalancer->Nodeport->cluserip->deployment->node->app container(app container doesn't have an ip)

replication controller: used as the autoscaling
limitation:work for single label set
plus point: avaiable rolling update here..like if app running on 1.0 it can be update to 1.1

replica set: used as the autoscaling
limitation:no rolling update avaiable here
pluse point: used for multiple label set

deployment: used for autoscaling
plusepoint:both thing avaiable here..multiple label  set,rolling update,

configmaps: it is used to hold the configuration related data in form of key and values , will use to configure application.
secret: it is used to hold the data but in the form of encrypted and same as key and value to decrypt the value we use
:-- echo -n "value"| base64 
type: generic,  docker, registery, tls

Resource quota

Namespaces

Limit Range

Rollout: update the deployment means we are going to update the image into the container suppose we were using nginx images version 1.0 now
we wish to use nginx version 2.1 so we will use rollout option to update. the rollout only get trigger when we make changes into
the node specification not the number of node.

minReadySecond: give the number in second, in this time being the pod will get ready
replica: it means, these number of number should alway be running suppose we have 10 node in the deployement so at the time of rollout, new number of 
node we create depends on maxsurge. suppose maxsurge is 2 so new 2 pod will create. and maxunavailable number of node will udpate and move to the new 
replica set.

maxsurge: these number of nodes will create to achive the replica must be running point..check the description in replica

maxunavailable: at the time of rolling update, one more replica set get created so what exactly happen there.
the number when we give here in the maxunavaiable that number of node get update and move into the new replica set
at a time, then next same number of node will pick and update and move to new replica set.

recreate : it same as rolling update but there is no number of replica should be avaiable during the update. it just create the new repica set
and udpate all the avaiable nodes and move to the new replica set.

resource request: tell the secheduler to assing wokernode which has limit number of ram or cpu or disk space.
resource:
  request:
    memory: 200Mi/200M/200Ti/200Gi
    cpu: 500m# 500 mili cpu
Limit: resource should not use more the mentioned limit range.

resource:
  request:
    memory: 200Mi/200M/200Ti/200Gi
    cpu: 500m# 500 mili cpu
  limits:
    memory: 200Mi

Namespace : it is same as we are create vitual machine on vmware, by default the new created node should use more then specific limited ram/cpu,
when ever we create the resource it created in the default namespace by default. how do we check where the resource support the namespace or not
it will check via this command kubectl api-resource|less .. in the name section you find true or false.

kubectl create <ns or namespace> <namespace name>
kubect apply pod.yml --namespace test
kubectl get pods -n test # which pods are running into the test namespace
kubectl get pods --all-namespace # see the all the namespace with pod details.
kubectl delete pode pod4 -n test # delete the pod in the test namespace.
metadata:
  namespace: test
kube-node-lease : worker nodes send heart beat to the master node to let them know that i am live. those uses this namespace.
kube-public: only those node which not require any kind of authentication that lies in this namespace.
kube-system: all the system management realated like scheduler,etcd,api-server,controll all lies under this namespace.   
kubectl config set-context  --current --namespace=test # make test default namespace
servicename.namespacename.sve.cluster.local # to access the pod from one namespace to another.
# set the number of resource can be created within the namespace, if someone try to create more give error.
spec:
   hard:
     pods: 2

Get the current context.
kubectl config current-context
foo
Switch current context.
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop

Create vs Apply
kubectl create can be used to create new resources while kubectl apply inserts or updates resources while maintaining any manual changes made like scaling pods.

--record - Add the current command as an annotation to the resource.
--recursive - Recursively look for yaml in the specified directory.

Types of Services

ClusterIP − This helps in restricting the service within the cluster. It exposes the service within the defined Kubernetes cluster.

spec:
   type: NodePort
   ports:
   - port: 8080
      nodePort: 31999
      name: NodeportService
NodePort − It will expose the service on a static port on the deployed node. A ClusterIP service, to which NodePort service will route, is automatically created. The service can be accessed from outside the cluster using the NodeIP:nodePort.

spec:
   ports:
   - port: 8080
      nodePort: 31999
      name: NodeportService
      clusterIP: 10.20.30.40
Load Balancer − It uses cloud providers’ load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP services are created automatically to which the external load balancer will route.

A full service yaml file with service type as Node Port. Try to create one yourself.

apiVersion: v1

***********************************

apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController --------------------------> 1
metadata:
   name: Tomcat-ReplicationController --------------------------> 2
spec:
   replicas: 3 ------------------------> 3
   template:
      metadata:
         name: Tomcat-ReplicationController
      labels:
         app: App
         component: neo4j
      spec:
         containers:
         - name: Tomcat- -----------------------> 4
         image: tomcat: 8.0
         ports:
            - containerPort: 7474 ------------------------> 5
Setup Details
Kind: ReplicationController → In the above code, we have defined the kind as replication controller which tells the kubectl that the yaml file is going to be used for creating the replication controller.

name: Tomcat-ReplicationController → This helps in identifying the name with which the replication controller will be created. If we run the kubctl, get rc < Tomcat-ReplicationController > it will show the replication controller details.

replicas: 3 → This helps the replication controller to understand that it needs to maintain three replicas of a pod at any point of time in the pod lifecycle.

name: Tomcat → In the spec section, we have defined the name as tomcat which will tell the replication controller that the container present inside the pods is tomcat.

containerPort: 7474 → It helps in making sure that all the nodes in the cluster where the pod is running the container inside the pod will be exposed on the same port 7474.

apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 --------------------->1
kind: ReplicaSet --------------------------> 2
metadata:
   name: Tomcat-ReplicaSet
spec:
   replicas: 3
   selector:
      matchLables:
         tier: Backend ------------------> 3
      matchExpression:
{ key: tier, operation: In, values: [Backend]} --------------> 4
template:
   metadata:
      lables:
         app: Tomcat-ReplicaSet
         tier: Backend
      labels:
         app: App
         component: neo4j
   spec:
      containers:
      - name: Tomcat
      image: tomcat: 8.0
      ports:
      - containerPort: 7474
Setup Details
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 → In the above code, the API version is the advanced beta version of Kubernetes which supports the concept of replica set.

kind: ReplicaSet → We have defined the kind as the replica set which helps kubectl to understand that the file is used to create a replica set.

tier: Backend → We have defined the label tier as backend which creates a matching selector.

{key: tier, operation: In, values: [Backend]} → This will help matchExpression to understand the matching condition we have defined and in the operation which is used by matchlabel to find details.

Run the above file using kubectl and create the backend replica set with the provided definition in the yaml file.


apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 --------------------->1
kind: Deployment --------------------------> 2
metadata:
   name: Tomcat-ReplicaSet
spec:
   replicas: 3
   template:
      metadata:
         lables:
            app: Tomcat-ReplicaSet
            tier: Backend
   spec:
      containers:
         - name: Tomcatimage:
            tomcat: 8.0
            ports:
               - containerPort: 7474
In the above code, the only thing which is different from the replica set is we have defined the kind as deployment.
